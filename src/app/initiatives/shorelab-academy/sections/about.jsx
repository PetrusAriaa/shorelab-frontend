              For the past two years, ShoreLab Academy has empowered university students with hands-on marine conservation experience. Weâ€™ve completed 8 projects involving 167 participants, collaborating with local marine organizations, the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fishery, and Kampus Merdeka.

              Our mission is to immerse students from Marine Technology and related majors in real-world conservation, enabling them to identify issues and create innovative solutions. Each program culminates in a Capstone Project and Deliverables, showcasing their work. All our initiatives are held exclusively in Indonesia.
