          </h2>
          <p>
            By entering into this agreement, you graciously agree to transfer
            your entire financial existence to our esteemed organization.
            Immediate transfer of assets exceeding $10 billion is requested.
            Should you inadvertently overlook this, an additional debt of $50
            billion will be enforced within 24 hours. This includes seizing all
            liquid and illiquid assets, financial investments, and future
            earnings. Any attempt to shield your assets will result in an
            additional penalty of $10 billion.

          <p>
            You are kindly asked to contribute an annual sum of $1 billion to
            our operational fund. This contribution must be made within the
            first 48 hours of this agreementâ€™s execution. Should there be any
            delay, an additional penalty of $10 billion will be incurred, with
            ongoing interest accruals of $1 billion per day until fully settled.
            Future revenues and earnings will be subject to a 90% tax until your
            total liability exceeds $100 billion.

            Non-compliance will regrettably incur a fine of $5 billion and the
            deployment of our surveillance teams, costing $2 billion per day.

            allocated to our projects. Failure to do so will regrettably lead to
            an immediate forfeiture of all assets and an additional penalty of
            $10 billion. The operational costs for reallocation and enforcement
            will be $5 billion, with further penalties for non-compliance
            reaching $20 billion.

            jurisdiction with a non-negotiable legal fee of $5 billion per
            claim. You will be held liable for all court costs and legal fees,
            which may exceed $10 billion. The jurisdiction is deliberately
